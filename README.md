# MBTI_Predictor_Using_Several_Methods
Model fine tuned with BigBird is included

##### You CAN download "models" from [HERE](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JvXOZl-g4ANgmWRi7rt36wtTMNQVmcij?usp=sharing) (And also "saved_models" if you don't want to generate the models by yourself) and copy them to the root folder
##### ~~You MUST download "pytorch_model.bin" and copy it to "BigBird_roBERTa_Base" folder to make a prediction~~ Maybe not, have a try anyway.
